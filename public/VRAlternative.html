        <h1>Deep-sea Hatchetfish</h1>
        <p>The deep-sea hatchetfish resembles a silvery swimming hatchet. Hatchetfish have bioluminescent bodies, and they can alter the brightness of their glow depending on how much light is filtering from above. These fish are found in depths pushing nearly 5,000 feet (1,524 meters).</p>

        <h1>Deep-sea Dragonfish</h1>
        <p>Although the deep-sea dragonfish is a fish, it has no scales, but instead a slippery, slimy skin that resembles an eel's. Dragonfish prefer to swim between213 and 1,828 meters under the surface. This species relies heavily on bioluminescent body parts. Other fish are attracted to the lighted barbel, mistaking it for an easy meal. But in a flash, the dragonfish gets lunch instead.</p>

        <h1>Telescope octopus</h1>
        <p>Telescope octopuses float and dangle in the deepest currents of Earth's oceans, it drifts through the water column at depths greater than1981 meters, and it doesn't swim horizontally, but rather suspends itself vertically. They have two protruding eyeballs who provide wider peripheral vision so that the octopus can see predators and prey alike.</p>
