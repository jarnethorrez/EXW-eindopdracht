        <h1>Jelly Fish</h1>
        <p>Jellyfish are found all over the world, from surface waters to the deep sea. Jellyfish are eaten by humans in certain cultures, being considered a delicacy in some Asian countries. They are also used in research, where the green fluorescent protein, used by some species to cause bioluminescence, has been adapted as a fluorescent marker for genes inserted into other cells or organisms.</p>

        <h1>Benthocodon</h1>
        <p>The benthocodon is an unusual type of jellyfish that prefers an environment far out at sea at depths of more than 762 meters, often right on the seafloor. Although many types of jellyfish are transparent, the benthocodon has an opaque reddish coloring on its bell</p>

        <h1>Goblin Shark</h1>
        <p>Goblin sharks have a protruding snout that looks like a pointy sword. What's more, these sharks aren't your stereotypical gray color. Instead, their skin has a distinct pink hue.These sharks typically cruise way down to 914 meters, and the older they get, the deeper they dive. It is usually between 3 and 4 m long when mature, though it can grow considerably larger.</p>

        <h1>Deep-sea Hatchetfish</h1>
        <p>The deep-sea hatchetfish resembles a silvery swimming hatchet. Hatchetfish have bioluminescent bodies, and they can alter the brightness of their glow depending on how much light is filtering from above. These fish are found in depths pushing nearly 5,000 feet (1,524 meters).</p>

        <h1>Deep-sea Dragonfish</h1>
        <p>Although the deep-sea dragonfish is a fish, it has no scales, but instead a slippery, slimy skin that resembles an eel's. Dragonfish prefer to swim between213 and 1,828 meters under the surface. This species relies heavily on bioluminescent body parts. Other fish are attracted to the lighted barbel, mistaking it for an easy meal. But in a flash, the dragonfish gets lunch instead.</p>

        <h1>Telescope octopus</h1>
        <p>Telescope octopuses float and dangle in the deepest currents of Earth's oceans, it drifts through the water column at depths greater than1981 meters, and it doesn't swim horizontally, but rather suspends itself vertically. They have two protruding eyeballs who provide wider peripheral vision so that the octopus can see predators and prey alike.</p>

        <h1>Dumbo Octopus</h1>
        <p>This octopus may look dainty, but it's actually durable enough to make it the deepest dwelling octopus known to science. It prefers to make its home all the way down between 2987 and 3962 meters. Unlike most octopuses, this species doesn't chomp and grind food with a beaklike mouth. Instead, it simply swallows its prey whole. So if you happen to be on the dumbo octopus's menu, it probably doesn't seem nearly as cute.</p>

      <p>You're now at 4km depth in the see, all light already vanished 3km ago and you're only 5km from the deepest sea floor</p>
      <p>We hope you enjoyed our little experiment!</p>
